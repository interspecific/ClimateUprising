  <h2>Will the U.S. Join the Adults in the Room?</h2>
  <h3>It's Time that we Stand Up to the Profiteering Bullies. Protect all Humans, the Planet, and our Future.</h1>
  <div class="card">


    <h3>The Global Shift Has Already Begun</h3>
    <p>
      Around the world, countries are taking climate change seriously. They’re implementing universal healthcare, building walkable cities, investing in green infrastructure, and protecting civil, human, and environmental rights—including for immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, women, men, Indigenous communities, and animals. Climate action is not separate from justice—it is the backbone of a fair and livable future.
    </p>

    <h3>Why the U.S. Must Catch Up</h3>
    <p>
      The United States emits more greenhouse gases per person than nearly any other country—and yet, it has fallen behind on the global stage in addressing climate change. Other nations are committing to net-zero targets, transforming food and energy systems, and embedding social equity in environmental policies. If we want to lead, we must act now.
    </p>

    <h3>What Climate Mitigation Really Means</h3>
    <p>
      Climate mitigation isn’t just about cutting emissions. It’s about creating a healthier, more resilient society. According to the <a href="https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/what-climate-change-mitigation-and-why-it-urgent" target="_blank">UNDP</a>, this includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ending fossil fuel dependence and investing in renewables</li>
      <li>Enhancing energy efficiency across buildings and infrastructure</li>
      <li>Transforming agriculture and protecting ecosystems like forests, wetlands, and grasslands</li>
      <li>Shifting toward public transit and low-emissions mobility</li>
      <li>Ensuring <a href="https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/what-just-transition-and-why-it-important" target="_blank">just transitions</a> for workers and communities</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Paris Agreement and Global Climate Frameworks</h3>
    <p>
      In 2015, nearly every country signed onto the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement" target="_blank">Paris Agreement</a> to limit warming to 1.5°C. To meet this goal, countries must cut emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050. Every nation submits <a href="https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/NDCs-nationally-determined-contributions-climate-change-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank">Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)</a> and long-term strategies (<a href="https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/long-term-climate-strategies-LTS-LTLEDS-climate-change" target="_blank">LT-LEDS</a>) outlining their plans.
    </p>

    <h3>The U.S. Role in Global Solidarity</h3>
    <p>
      As one of the world’s largest historical emitters, the U.S. has a moral and strategic responsibility to lead. That includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Investing in frontline and under-resourced communities</li>
      <li>Supporting <a href="https://www.unep.org/events/working-group/transforming-extractive-industries-sustainable-development" target="_blank">sustainable development</a> abroad through aid and technology</li>
      <li>Upholding democratic values and <a href="https://climatepromise.undp.org/what-we-do/areas-of-work/net-zero-pathways" target="_blank">net-zero pathways</a> that promote equity</li>
      <li>Recognizing and reducing the U.S. footprint in supply chains, food systems, and financial flows</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Scientific Consensus</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/" target="_blank">IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report</a> confirms: the science is clear, the risks are high, and the solutions are within reach. If we act boldly now, we can still avoid irreversible damage—and build a world that’s safer, cleaner, and more just.
    </p>

    <h3>A Message to the U.S.—From Teachers to Lawmakers</h3>
    <p>
      Whether you’re an educator shaping minds, a policymaker writing laws, a planner designing communities, or a scientist doing research, your work is vital. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the world is moving forward with or without the United States.
